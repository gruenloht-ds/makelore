# Web scrape character names from the elder scrolls (TES) games
# https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page

# They seem to have most of the names and links to profiles here: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names
# The breakdown is by race and sex

# There are two types of names on this page, 
#   1. Names with links to profiles/character information
#   2. Names without profiles/character information or links to such info

# As the structure of the names on each page is roughly the same, the code in each section will be roughly the same aswell
